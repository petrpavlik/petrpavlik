## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a staff software engineer with 15+ years of professional experience. My main background is definitely still in iOS development, but my full-stack skills are catching up.

My iOS journey got me interested in using Swift on the server and my profile has some SDKs I've created of forked and fixed you might find useful if server-side Swift isnyour jam.

These days I'm mostly of the opinion that software should be written in typescript unless you have a good reason to use something else.
